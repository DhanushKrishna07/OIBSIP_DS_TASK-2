This is task 2 of Oasis Infobyte | Data Science Domain.

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

 🌐Unemployment Analysis With Python📊
 
In this project, I explored and visualized unemployment trends in India using the latest data. Leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, I aimed to uncover patterns and correlations that could help understand the employment landscape better. 

Project Highlights:

•Comprehensive analysis of Indian unemployment data.•
•Visualization of employment trends using Seaborn and Plotly.
•Heatmap correlation analysis of the Iris dataset for comparison.

Steps Involved:

•Imported the Indian unemployment dataset and Iris dataset.
•Checked for and handled any missing values.
•Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.
•Visualized correlations within the Iris dataset using a heatmap.
•Created histograms to visualize estimated employment and  unemployment rates across different areas in India.
•Employed Seaborn and Plotly for creating insightful visualizations.
•Analyzed the visualizations to draw meaningful conclusions about unemployment trends in India.

Key Takeaway:

🔑This project highlights the power of data visualization in understanding complex datasets. By visualizing employment trends, we can gain insights that are not immediately apparent from raw data, aiding in better decision-making and policy formulation.💡
